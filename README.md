<em><h4>Powerful, minimalistic approach to declaring Dendritic Nix host configurations.</h4></em>

</td>  
<td>

üè† Concise host definitions ([example](templates/default/modules/_example/hosts.nix))

```nix
# modules/hosts.nix -- see schema at types.nix
{
  # define a host with single user:
  den.x86-64-linux.work-laptop.users.vic = {};

  # that's it! the rest is adding flake.aspects
}
```

üß© [aspect-oriented](https://github.com/vic/flake-aspects) dendritic modules ([example](templates/default/modules/_example/aspects.nix))

```nix
# modules/work-laptop.nix
{
  flake.aspects.work-laptop = {
    darwin = ...; # (see nix-darwin options)
    nixos  = ...; # (see nixos options)

    includes = with flake.aspects; [ vpn office ];
  };
}

# modules/vic.nix -- see <den>/nix/aspects.nix
{
  flake.aspects.vic = {
    includes = with flake.aspects; [ tiling-wm secrets ];
    homeManager = ...; # dot-files, etc.
    nixos = ...; # vic's common os level services.

    # `vic` provides `work-laptop` to configure os.
    provides.work-laptop = { host, user }: _: {
      darwin.system.primaryUser = user.userName;
      nixos.users.users.vic.isNormalUser = true;
    };
  };
}
```

**‚ùÑÔ∏è Try it now! launch our template VM:**

```console
nix run "github:vic/den?dir=templates/default#vm" --no-write-lock-file
```

or clone it and adapt to your liking:

```console
nix flake init -t github:vic/den
nix run .#vm # launch the VM as you edit
```

## Usage

The [syntax](nix/types.nix) for a Host and its Users is concise and [focused](nix/os-config.nix) on system definition not on their features.

Host and User features are configured by using [flake.aspects](https://github.com/vic/flake-aspects). For global features, this library [adds](nix/aspects-config.nix) `flake.aspects.default.host` and `flake.aspects.default.user`.

The following code example tries to take you into a tour of `den` usage. Remember that you are free to have as many or as few files as you want, the Dendritic pattern imposes no rules on where or how your files named. It is up to you to organize and come up with a good directory structure and aspect organization that make sense to you.

```nix
# modules/hosts.nix -- see <den>/nix/types.nix for schema.
{
  # Most common use is just a oneliner: define a host with a single user.
  # You can nest the definition when needed, eg. to set non-default values.

  den.x86-64-linux.work-laptop.users.vic = {};
}
```

> That's pretty much it! as far as host definition is concerned.

Now you need to enhance the host and user aspects using [`flake.aspects`](https://github.com/vic/flake-aspects), refer to its README and tests for usage. The rest of this guide is an example of aspects customization.

From our example, `class` is inferred as `nixos` because its `system` name,
aspect-names are `work-laptop` for host, and `vic` for user.

`flake.nixosConfigurations.work-laptop` will import `flake.modules.nixos.work-laptop`.
the `flake.aspects` system computes the final aggregated module by:

- using global `flake.aspects.default.host.${host.class}` definitions.
- calling `flake.aspects.default.host.includes` with `{ host }`
  to obtain `${host.class}` modules from other aspects.
- calling `flake.aspects.${user.aspect}.provides.${host.aspect}` with `{ host, user }`
  to obtain `${host.class}` modules from other aspects.
- all aspect dependencies are followed and all `${host.class}` modules
  collected and imported in the final `flake.modules.nixos.work-laptop` module.

The same would happen for any other host nix class, like `darwin`.

You can see these dependencies being defined at [`aspects-config.nix`](nix/aspects-config.nix).

In a similar fashion, user aspects have these dependencies:

- using global `flake.aspects.default.user.${user.class}` definitions.
- calling each `flake.aspects.default.user.includes` with `{ host, user }`
  to obtain more `${user.class}` modules from other aspects.

For user level configs common classes are `homeManager` or `hjem`.

Remember that dendritic aspects are incremental, and many different files can contribute to the same aspect. Read [vic](https://github.com/vic)'s [dendritic guide](https://vic.github.io/dendrix/Dendritic.html) for more on this. In our following example, we try to keep things minimal, but files will grow or be split into other modules as you improve them.

Now, lets continue our example by adding some dendritic modules:

```nix
# modules/host-defaults.nix -- these apply to all hosts
{
  flake.aspects.default.host = {
    nixos.system.stateVersion = "25.11";
    darwin.system.stateVersion = 6;
  };
}

# modules/work/thinkpad.nix
{
  flake.aspects.work-laptop.nixos = {
    networking.hostName = "penguin";
    imports = [ ./_thinkpad/hardware.nix ./_thinkpad/filesystems.nix ];
  };
}

# modules/work/macbook.nix
{
  flake.aspects.work-laptop.darwin = {
    networking.hostName = "fruit";
  };
}

# modules/work/features.nix -- add same features to all work laptops
{
  flake.aspects = { aspects, ... }: {
    work-laptop.includes = with aspects; [ vpn meetings office ];
  };
}

# modules/vic/base.nix -- included on all hosts where vic exists
{
  flake.aspects = { aspects, ... }: {
    vic.homeManager = ...; # dot-files, basic environment.
    vic.includes = with aspects; [ 
      tiling-desktop vim-btw secret-vault.provides.vic-personal
    ];
  };
}

# modules/vic/at-work-laptop.nix
{
  flake.aspects.vic.provides.work-laptop = {host, user}: _: {
    darwin.system.primaryUser = "vic";
    nixos.users.users.vic = {
      isNormalUser = true;
      extraGroups = [ "wheel" ];
    };
  };
}
```
